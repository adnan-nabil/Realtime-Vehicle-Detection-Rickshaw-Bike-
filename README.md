# Rickshaw and Bike Detection

1. This is a PyQt project. So, here we can input a video, then model can detect rickshaw and bike realtime. 
2. The dataset I collected randomly from google search.
3. And then annotate with the bounding box using Labelme tool.
4. For model, I have used here YOLO v8 model.
5. The accuracy of the model is 91%.
6. We can use this for detecting wrong side traffic movement of rickshaw and bike in dhaka city.
